## Solar system simulator in OpenGL
Name: Jarin Thundathil
Platform: MacOS 

### TO RUN:
1. ```mkdir build```
2. ```cd build```
3. ```cmake ..```
4. ```make```
5. ```./solarsystem```

on visual studio I guess you can just hit the play button. 

### CONTROLS:
Animation:

    'W' increases the speed and 'S' decreases the speed.

    press 'SPACE' to pause and unpause the simulation.

    Reset with 'R'

Camera:

    Scroll wheel zooms in and out, centered on the sun. You can hold the right
    mouse button and drag to rotate about the sun. 


Window:

    drag and resize the window as desired. 


Note: I don't use ImGUI to control this, but I kept the FPS counter anyways.
